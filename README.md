PasswordGeek
============

Encryption based Password Management utility

PasswordGeek is a very easy to use application that determines the strength of the passwords entered by the user and stores them in an encrypted format (RSA and MD5). The password strength is computed by analyzing its character content and frequency, along with dictionary word analysis. Even the source code does not reveal any information to the hacker about the stored passwords. 

This project has been hosted at SourceForge and is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/passwordgeek.
